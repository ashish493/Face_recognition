# Face_recognition
Recognizing faces in images as well as in videos using OpenCV

 
This project is under construction 

I will be using packages of imutils, argparse,opencv2, pickles and OS for the code.
I will be using the images of characters of the The fast and furious movie series
as the dataset for training.

It uses CNN (from opencv module) for training of images.
I'm not using any frameworks like pytorch, tensorflow, as this is meant to be a simple project...

This project is based on [this](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/18/face-recognition-with-opencv-python-and-deep-learning/) blog.
